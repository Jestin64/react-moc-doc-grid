Thank you for taking the time to review my application For FULLSTACK DEVELOPER(FRONTEND bias).

This project was made in React, material-ui, msw, react-beautiful-dnd, lodash for debounced (removed) and done as per the requirements to the best of my knowledge,

Mocked backend rest api calls:

# Setup:

    1) Install the dependencies with npm install or yarn install
    2) Run with npm run start or yarn start

# Working (Test in incognito for a fresh start):

    1) you should see a set of 5 cards with thumbnails and a text at the bottom showing the time taken to save the last data order.
    2) When dragging the order of the cards, after 5 seconds the auto save mock api will be called and and the new data order will be saved to localstorage.
    3) If no change detected, it will not auto save.

    or
    1) If docker is installed and running, run the command: docker-compose up --build
    2) If everythig runs as expected, then navigate to http://localhost:3000/

# Testing:

    Tested on personal machine localhost numerous times with throlling to achieve acceptable consistent user experience,

If any queries or complications please feel free to reach out to me on my email jestinjois64@gmail
